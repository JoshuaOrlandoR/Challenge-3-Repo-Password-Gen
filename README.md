# Challenge-3-Repo-Password-Gen
This is challenge involves modifying starter code of a password generator to fix error/bugs, and clean the code up.
Creating (using starter code) a password generator for the third weekly assignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
In this assignment, I was given starter code for a password generator. 
Using JavaScript that I learned in both bootcamp, as well as through my own research and experiments, I utilized various techniqes to create a functional password generator.
This generator prompts the user for their desired password length, as well as various critera the password will follow. 
The generator asks the user if they would like numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, as well as special characters to be included in the code. 
All accepted criteria will be used to create the password, which will then be shown to the user.
